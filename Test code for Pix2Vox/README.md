# Test code for running forward path of Pix2Vox

# Method to test Pix2Vox on own image :
1)  Download the required libraries from the requirements.txt
2)  Place the test.py file in the main Pix2Vox author code directory
3)  Change the paths to the pre-trained model and input image appropriately
4)  Run python test.py to get the final image

A sample_images folder will be created with the 3d image visualization in an image.
